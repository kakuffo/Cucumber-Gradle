You can implement missing steps with the snippets below:

@Given("^User searched for Lenovo Laptop$")
public void user_searched_for_Lenovo_Laptop() throws Throwable {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new PendingException();
}

@When("^Add the first laptop that appears in the search result to the basket$")
public void add_the_first_laptop_that_appears_in_the_search_result_to_the_basket() throws Throwable {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions

}

@Then("^User basket should display with (\\d+)$")
public void user_basket_should_display_with(int arg1) throws Throwable {
